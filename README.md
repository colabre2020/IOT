IoT - Internet of Things

Aurdino based project for Rural farming.
Problem Solving - Aged Farmers in Rural areas struggle with lot of errands like swithing the motors pumps in sheds in hoy summers. Which is very pathetic task for them all around the season.

Insights - As per my analysis and interaction with them found that lot of time and energy wasted to switch the devices near their farm lands and house. During that time they can utilize their time and energy for some other tasks.

Brainstorm - So i come up with couple of ideas to resolve their repetative task to a automated way using IoT and Machine learning solutions which will save their time, so they can focus on some important work.

Prototype - The following application code developed to connect with a Bluetooth and Wireless protocol to operate the water pumps in thier farm fields. I am planning to add some sensor to monitor the temperature of the soil, so water pump can activated when its moisture level decrease.

The current solution in testing phase, so the code updates may change.
