IoT - Internet of Things

Aurdino based project for Rural farming.
Problem Solving - Aged Farmers in Rural areas struggle with lot of errands like swithing the motors pumps in sheds in hoy summers. Which is very pathetic task for them all around the season.

Insights - As per my analysis and interaction with them found that lot of time and energy wasted to switch the devices near their farm lands and house. During that time they can utilize their time and energy for some other tasks.

Brainstorm - So i come up with couple of ideas to resolve their repetative task to a automated way using IoT and Machine learning solutions which will save their time, so they can focus on some important work.

Prototype - The following application code developed to connect with a Bluetooth and Wireless protocol to operate the water pumps in thier farm fields. I am planning to add some sensor to monitor the temperature of the soil, so water pump can activated when its moisture level decrease.

The current solution in testing phase, so the code updates may change.

## Problem Overview -
# Problem: 
Aged farmers in rural areas spend significant time and effort manually switching on/off water pumps for irrigation, especially during hot summers.
# Challenge: 
The task is physically demanding, repetitive, and consumes a lot of time that could be better spent on other critical farm management activities.

# Project Insights -
Farmer's Struggles: Through direct interaction and analysis, I found that manual operation of water pumps is inefficient, and it wastes valuable energy and time.
Opportunity: Automating the process with IoT and machine learning solutions would save farmers time, reduce physical strain, and ensure efficient water usage.

Brainstorming Ideas
I've identified some core ideas to address this challenge:

Automation: Use IoT devices (Arduino) for automating the switching of water pumps.
Sensor Integration: Add soil moisture sensors that will monitor the soil's moisture level, ensuring that the pumps turns on only when needed, optimizing water usage.
Bluetooth/Wireless Protocol: Leverage Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for communication between the pumps and the controlling device, allowing remote operation from a mobile phone or any remote control interface.
Machine Learning: Eventually integrate machine learning to predict water needs based on historical data and environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and time of year.
Prototype

# Hardware Setup:

Arduino Board: An Arduino-based microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno, NodeMCU, or Raspberry Pi) to control the water pump and communicate with sensors.

Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Module: Modules like HC-05 (Bluetooth) or ESP8266 (Wi-Fi) for communication.

Soil Moisture Sensor: This sensor detects the moisture level in the soil and helps automate the pump based on real-time soil conditions.

Water Pump: Typically a 12V DC pump or a relay-controlled AC pump for irrigation.

Temperature and Humidity Sensor (optional): You can integrate a DHT11 or DHT22 sensor to monitor environmental conditions that might affect irrigation needs.

# Software Setup:

Arduino Code (Basic Workflow): Connect soil moisture sensor to the Arduino >> Read the moisture value >> Use a threshold moisture level to decide whether to activate or deactivate the water pump >> Implement Bluetooth or Wi-Fi communication for remote control (using a mobile app or computer interface).
